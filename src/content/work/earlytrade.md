#### Achievements

- Developed a Design System from scratch using Storybook and the Material UI library. This project provides a library of components that can be consumed from different applications within the range of solutions provided by the company.
- Worked on a greenfield project which launched an MVP version within 6 months and that later onboarded some real customers to try the beta version. Used a monorepo for the project and the UI was built with Vite, React, and the component library developed in-house.
- Executed a rebranding of the company's image. A new logo, colour palette and fonts were introduced so all the user facing products were migrated to follow the new brand.
