#### Achievements

In my role, I help to transition the architecture of the app to a Redux model. I took charge of introducing new features, including a background job importer for financial data plugged into a MongoDB instance. I conducted substantial refactorings of legacy code, enhancing its manageability, extensibility, and performance. Additionally, I made contributions to the team's processes, defining the branching model and release procedures.
