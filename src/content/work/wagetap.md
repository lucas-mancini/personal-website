#### Achievements

- Modernised a quite outdated React Native codebase by updating the framework and other dependencies to their latest versions. As a result, the user perceived crash rate was drastically reduced from 0.85% to 0.06% (28 day rolling average).
- Worked on a new greenfield project to expose a web interface for the product.
- Participated in the design and implementation of several growth and marketing experiments to drive revenue.
- Architectured a custom build process to build multiple flavours of the apps from the same codebase in other to launch the application in other regions, along with their “i18n” configuration.
